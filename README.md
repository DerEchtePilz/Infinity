# Infinity

## Disclaimer

Infinity is still under heavy development. It is not ready to be played. If you still choose to build Infinity yourself, please be warned that the worlds you generate will be empty, and you may get an error upon loading the server.

## Introduction

Infinity is a Minecraft plugin for Paper servers. It adds a custom-made story game to Minecraft.

When installing this plugin, you have two options:
- You can play Minecraft like normal and enjoy the `Overworld`, `Nether` and `End` the base game gives you
- You can also play Infinity and use the worlds this gamemode provides

You always have the option to switch which gamemode you want to play. Minecraft and Infinity will be handled separately and you will have
- separate inventories and ender chests
- separate levels
- separate spawn points
- separate chats (although this may change depending on feedback)
- separate health and hunger points
- separate potion effects

This effectively allows you to play Infinity while still being able to play vanilla Minecraft which stays untouched.

**Due to a few technical problems, you will not be able to gain advancements while playing Infinity. If you find a solution, please open an [issue](https://github.com/DerEchtePilz/Infinity/issues/new) or a [PR](https://github.com/DerEchtePilz/Infinity/compare).**

## General concept

Due to Infinity's nature as a story game, I do not want to go into too much detail. If there's anything that you think should go into here, please open an issue.
